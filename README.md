### **INTRODUCTION**
Predicting stock prices using AI has become a prevalent application in financial markets. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, AI models analyze historical data, market trends, and various economic indicators to forecast stock movements. Investors leverage these predictions to make informed decisions, enhancing their ability to navigate the complexities of stock trading. This innovative approach to stock market analysis showcases the transformative potential of AI in shaping the future of investment strategies.

Technologies I used:
  - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to create a simple web demo.
  - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to build a deep learning model.
  - [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) to preprocess data for training model/
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org) process data.
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) read and handle data.
  - [Streamlit documentation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtqF5YXg7GLmCvTswG32NqQypOuYkPRUE) to learn the basic of streamlit.

### **INSTALLATION**
I highly recommend you using Google Colab to run the dogcat_classification.ipynb file because it already has packages and libraries I use. But if you want to run on your local machine, following the instruction below.
  - Install essential libraries and packages:
  
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### **DATA INFORMATION** 

There are 4 data files, each file represents a stock dataset for a company. There are 4 companies: FPT, MSN, PNJ, and VIC.

### **LSTM**

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a specialized recurrent neural network architecture designed for handling sequential data. It excels in capturing and retaining information over extended periods, making it ideal for tasks like natural language processing and time series analysis. With unique memory cells and gating mechanisms, LSTM effectively addresses the challenges of long-term dependencies, contributing to its widespread adoption in various applications within the realm of deep learning.
