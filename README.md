### **INTRODUCTION**
Predicting stock prices using AI has become a prevalent application in financial markets. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, AI models analyze historical data, market trends, and various economic indicators to forecast stock movements. Investors leverage these predictions to make informed decisions, enhancing their ability to navigate the complexities of stock trading. This innovative approach to stock market analysis showcases the transformative potential of AI in shaping the future of investment strategies.

Technologies I used:
  - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to create a simple web demo.
  - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to build a deep learning model.
  - [Sklearn] (https://scikit-learn.org/) to preprocess data for training model/
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org) process data.
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) read and handle data.
  - [Streamlit documentation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtqF5YXg7GLmCvTswG32NqQypOuYkPRUE) to learn the basic of streamlit.

### **INSTALLATION**
I highly recommend you using Google Colab to run the dogcat_classification.ipynb file because it already has packages and libraries I use. But if you want to run on your local machine, following the instruction below.
  - Install essential libraries and packages:
  
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### **LSTM**

MobileNet V2 is a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for computer vision tasks. MobileNet V2 utilizes depthwise separable convolutions, making it ideal for applications on mobile devices and embedded systems. With its compact design and impressive performance, MobileNet V2 is a popular choice for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. This README provides an overview of using MobileNet V2 for the task of animal classification.
